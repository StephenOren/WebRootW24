    <p>Description: The website starts talking about what a web application, differences between websites, the development of a web application and the skills needed to 
      accomplish it and shows various web application frameworks for both front end and back end. This website provides a basic idea to those stepping into web application 
      development. In my application development career, I will refer to this website to get an idea on how to get started in building web apps and possibly use any frameworks 
      it suggested.</p>
    
    <p>Web application is an interactive program that runs on a web server accessed through a web browser. One difference between a web application and a website, is that a web 
      application uses an API that takes data from users and adjusts the app based on data, while a website is static. Web application development is all about fulfilling a need. 
      It ensures compatibility with both Android and iOS, identifies life cycle and optimization metrics, and building an iterative user interface. Skills needed for web app 
      development is knowledge of a programming language, deployment of both front end like JavaScript, CSS, html, and back end skills, and knowledge of Ajax, which is a collection 
      of techniques that can be used to develop a web application.</p>

    <p>Description: This website goes into a bit more detail about web applications, web application development and why it's important, how it works. They provide examples of web 
      apps and how each work and the 7 different types of web applications. It also goes into detail about the difference between web apps and mobile apps. This website is useful 
      for beginners starting out in web application development to expand their knowledge on what web applications are. In a web application development career, I will use this to 
      reinforce what I know about web application and the development side and use the various information here as a reference to get an idea of what to build.</p><br />

    <p>Web application development is about creating software and web based applications running on a web server accessed over the internet using web browsers. Involves designing, 
      developing, testing, and deploying web based systems that allows users to interact with the data presented to perform various tasks. Benefits include being faster and 
      affordable to build compared to native mobile apps, easy to maintain and update, works on any device with a compatible browser, don't have to be installed, more secure since 
      they're built on dedicated servers with a robust security infrastructure than locally installed apps on devices. The 7 types of web applications include static web apps, 
      dynamic web apps, E-Commerce web apps, single page web apps, progressive web apps, social media web apps, business web apps. Difference between a web and mobile app include 
      mobile apps being designed specifically for mobile devices and needed to be downloaded from a native play store, and web apps have to adjust to mobile devices. Mobile apps 
      are typically more expensive and harder to build, and maintain in the long run.</p>

      <a href="https://budibase.com/blog/how-to-make-a-web-app/" target="_blank">How to Build a Web App: Beginner's Guide (2024)</a>

      <p>Description: This website goes into great detail in building in web application development. It talks about two approaches to do web application development, slow code and 
        low code, how low code affected building web apps in 2022, prerequisites to create a web app, and 12 different steps to approach making a web app. It's useful for beginners 
        who plan to develop a web application and it provides steps on how to approach building it that is broken into sections. In my web application career, I will refer back to 
        this to reinforce and reference what I know and try to build a web app with the steps in mind.</p>
      
      <p>The website provides 12 different steps broken into 4 different stages. The first is the ideation stage, which includes sourcing an idea, doing market research, and 
        defining the functionality of your web app. The second stage is the design stage, which includes sketching your web app, planning the workflow, wireframe the UI, and 
        getting validation regarding the idea of the app. The third stage is the development stage, which includes the architect of the database, developing the front end, and 
        building the backend. The fourth and final stage is the launch stage, which includes hosting the web app and deploying the web app.</p>

      <p>Description: This website talks about what frameworks are in web development. It talks about the benefits of using web development frameworks, the difference between 
        different types of frameworks, 10 different examples of frameworks and their features, benefits, and drawbacks, and how to choose them. This might be useful for people who 
        don't know how to start developing their web app after designing. It talks about various frameworks to choose from and their advantages and disadvantages. In my web 
        application career, I think I will use this as a reference when developing a web application. </p>
      
      <p>A framework in web development is a pre-built set of libraries, software tools, and the best practices to support the software development of web applications. Using web 
        development frameworks include streamlined development, speed and efficiency, integrated security, community support, enhanced performance, and scalability, and various 
        tools for testing and debugging. Different types of web frameworks include both frontend client-side frameworks and backend server-side frameworks. Frontend frameworks work 
        the the UI or user interface and user interactivity. Backend frameworks focus on the server-side logic of web apps. Backend frameworks manage server operations, communicate 
        with databases, and process requests on the user's side. Some advantages include rapid development which offers prebuilt components, consistency that enforces best 
        practices, security which frameworks come with built in security traits and protections, community and ecosystem, and scalability. Some disadvantages include requiring time 
        to learn, lack of flexibility on some frameworks, introduce performance overhead, keeping up with the framework updates and guaranteeing compatibility, and some frameworks 
        consuming more server resources.</p>

      <p>Description: This website doesn't necessarily provide resources for developing a web application, but it does explore other topics related to a web application developer. 
        It talks about various topics like what a web application is, why web application development is growing rapidly, what a web app developer is, how much companies creating 
        web apps, and benefits and drawbacks of no code web apps. I think this website can be useful for people looking to find more information on what it means to be a web 
        application developer. It looks into various aspects of web application development other than the technical side. In my web application career, I think I would use this to 
        reflect on my situation. </p>
      
      <p> Web application development has grown since the last decade because you can deliver your web apps across multiple devices easily and cheaply. You don't need to manage the 
        updates yourself because other developers can help you.  Four major plays in web application development include Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon. All these four 
        major companies are developing their own frameworks for building web apps. Most companies that lookout for skills in a web app developer are experienced with no code 
        platforms, knowledge of html, CSS, JavaScript and frameworks, and knowledge of development tools like GitHub. A high proportion of companies reported that their ideal web 
        app developer is one who has a degree in computer science, IT, or engineering. For how much a web app developer earns, it is said that the average salary for a full stack 
        developer is 100k per year, freelance consultants earn as little as 30k to 200k, mid-level web app developers earn between 70k to 105k, and junior developers earning 40k or 
        less,. Of course, there are other factors that can affect these.</p>

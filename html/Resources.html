    <p>Description: A small list of sensors that gives a small review about each one about an iPhone. These are useful for possibly forming project concepts or mobile application ideas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Proximity Sensor: Determines how close the iPhone is to the face. One example of this
        is the phone turning the screen off when you put your phone to your ear in a phone call.
      </li>
      <li>Accelerometer/Motion Sensor: Sensor that helps the screen switch from landscape to protrait modes based on whether
        yoyu're holding the pohone vertically or horizontally.
      </li>
      <li>Ambient Light Sensor: Determines how much light is available in the area surrounding the phone. Meaning it will automatically
        adjust screen brightness.
      </li>
      <li>Moisture Sensor: It isn't visible on screen or accesible through the IOS. It is a red indicator after the phone has been submerged.</li>
      <li>Gyroscope: It is a 3 axis gyroscope. Combined with the accelerometer, it can operate 6 axes. Makes devices more sensitive, responsivce, 
        and powerful for gaming, since they can react based on how you move and hold it.
      </li>
      <li>Compass: Used with GPS feature and locational tools to determine the iPhone's location, the direction it's facing.</li>
      <li>Barometer: Assess air pressure to help determine altitude. Used for locationa nd directions features.</li>
      <li>Touch ID: A thumbprint sensor embedded in teh home button lets you secure acces to your own device with you own biometric data. Other things include 
        being able to authorize purchases or unlock apps.
      </li>
      <li>Face ID: Uses a complex system to identify a person's face for security.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Might be considered sensors on the phone are the cameras and microphones built in the iPhone. They function similar to sensors, including WiFi chips and cellular radios.</p>

    <p>This website goes into a bit more detail about some of the iPhone sensors that were introduced in the first source. These more in depth explanations could help in forming more realistic mobile application ideas.</p><br />
    <ul>
      <li>Proximity Sensor: As mentioned above, the proximity sensor measures how close the sensor device is to the user. This helps it to close the screen as you move it to your ear.
        There's two types of proximity sensors in use. The capacitive and inductive sensors. The former is used the most in modern day phones.
        This sensor produces a varying capacitance that interacts with the oscillator. The change in capacitance is measured by some measurement component. The variables Distance and area are the most 
        important parts that affect the capacitance.
      </li>
      <li>Motion Sensor: Allows the iPhone to switch from a landscape to a portrait display depending on how you turn the phone. It involves detection of motion into an electrical current. This is achieved by measuring hte change in target field of view.
        Most of motion detectors are engineered to accurately access data on optical change up to 15-25 meters. The four main types of motion sensors are passive infrared sensors, ultrasonic, microwave, and tomographic detectors.
      </li>
      <li>Ambient Light Sensor: Detects the intensity of light around the phoen to adjust brightness. These sensors are buried just underneath the glass of the phone. These sensors, photoliodes, detect light and respond to the sensory input by generating a proportional voltage.
        This voltage travels to the LED driver mmode and manipulates the LED output current and light intensity to the phone. </li>
      <li>Moisture Sensor: This sensor works by alerting the user when it is close to water. You can envelop the sensor in a conductive glue as an insulating layer. </li>
    </ul>

      <p>This website goes into even more detail about how sensors work. This website introduces new sensors on the phone can help diversify ideas for mobile applications. Basically, every smartphone has 3 dimensional coordinate system that sensors detect and record in real time. The x axis is the width, y axis is the length, and z axis is the line that goes through the device. 
        The website goes on to talk about the three categories of sensors:
          <ul>
            <li>Motion Sensors: Detect movement, acceleration, and rotation along the three axes of the device's coordinate system.</li>
            <li>Position Sensors: Records the physical location of the device by identifying the phone's coordinates.</li>
            <li>Environmental Sensors: Detect any significant changes in the surroundings of your smartphone. Like lighting, pressure, temperature, adjusting brightness, displaying temperature, measuring air pressure etc.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The website goes on to list various different sensors that phones use, most of which is explained above this resource and will be listed below. They list things like the accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, gps, ambient light sensors, and proximity sensors.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gyroscope: Measures the rotation along the three axes of the device's coordinate system</li>
          <li>Magnetometer: Senses the phone's orientation according to the earth's magnetic field. Essential for navigation and compass apps.</li>
          <li>GPS - A sensor with antennas to help navigate by recieving signals from satellites that help calculate the distance traveled and the location of your phone.</li>

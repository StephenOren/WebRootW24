                    <span class="strong">Bio<br /></span>I've started doing a little bit of html around the end of hgihschool. By the time I got into college, I started exploring more on programming and developing skills regarding html, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm in my third year of college and I've gotten some experience in the following programming languages in C#, SQL, and Python and platforms such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, and Linux.

                Experience<br />
                <p>
                    I have created a few websites about myself when I first got here in college. My previous class has taught us how to create games in a canvas sheet and built websites that take user input on what they like about music. We have used a server to save and write data to a folder regarding the music website. Other than that, I've written simple programs that that take user input, do math calculations, and used objects to call on certain functions of a class. I've also learned a variety of new data structures such as stacks, queue, linked lists, and binary trees.
